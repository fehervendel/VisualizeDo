# VisualizeDo

### Short description
This is a TODO app with drag and drop functionality. The project has registration, so users can only see their own tables.
I choose this project, because it is a good project in terms of learning and implementing different features.
It is working with the main drag and drop and todo functionality, but open for further features as well, like team based todo tables.

## Features
Drag and drop.
Registration.
Authentication for secure login.

## Technologies
ASP.NET Core.
Authentication using JWT tokens.
SQL server for database.
